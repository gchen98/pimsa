Included in this directory are two examples of the types of priors that can be used in the analysis.

annotation: This example demonstrates a case where the study data had a continuous outcome variable and SNPs as predictors.  The Z matrix file (rows as SNPs, cols as covariates) includes an indicator variable as to whether the SNP in question was non-synonymous (1) or not (0).  The A matrix file (rows as SNPs, cols as genes) indicates whether two SNPs were co-located within the same gene.

endophenotype: This example demonstrates a case where the study had a dichotomous outcome, SNPs and two environmental variables as predictors.  Values in Z and A matrices are generated on the fly by the program.  The user must provide a set of prior genotypes in which the number and order of the SNPs line up with the study genotype file.  A endophenotype file lists the endophenotypes associate with each person in the prior genotype file.  The program then calculates, for any given model variable, the correlation between the model variable's prior genotypes and each endophenotype, storing this as a vector to be used in computing elements in the A matrix.  Selected elements of this vector are selected to be used in the Z matrix through the selected_endo tag.
